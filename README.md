## Installation

In order to install the zpa-app-connector-openshift please use the below steps

1. Login as kubeadmin and switch to default project. You will be on the default project when you login as kubeadmin unless there is a change in the settings. So you would not need any command to move to default project. \
If you are not on the default, please use the command\
    `oc project default`

2. Install the helm chart
From the folder , \
    `cd zpa-openshift`
    `helm install [NAME] [CHART] [flags]` \
    `helm install [NAME] --set zsglobal.provisionkey.value="<provision_key>" .` \
     You can retrieve the provisioning key from the [ZPA Admin Portal](https://admin.private.zscaler.com/). To learn more, see [About App Connector Provisioning Keys](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/about-connector-provisioning-keys).

3. Verify if the pods are running.
zscaler-zpa is the namespace that is added when this helm chart is installed \
    `oc get pods -n zscaler-zpa`
